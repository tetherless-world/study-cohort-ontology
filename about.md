Semantic Data Dictionary project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will let get you started on creating your own Semantic Data Dictionaries.

### Prerequisites

There are several required prerequisites to using the sdd2rdf.py script detailed [here]().

## Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - File reading, parsing, and writing
* [configparser](https://pypi.org/project/configparser/) - Configuration handling
* [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) - Semantics

### Tutorial

A step by step series of instructions and examples for installing the required libraries, creating an appropriate directory structure can be found [here](tutorial.html).

## Running the script

The sdd2rdf.py script can be run using python by specifying a configuration file associated with a project.

```
python sdd2rdf.py ExampleProject/config/config.ini.example
```

## Querying and Testing


## Applications

### Software applications that can be used to interpret Semantic Data Dictionaries

* [hadatac](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac)
* [sdd2rdf](https://github.com/tetherless-world/SemanticDataDictionary)
* [setlr](https://github.com/tetherless-world/setlr)
* [whyis](https://github.com/tetherless-world/whyis)

Additional notes about how to use Semantic Data Dictionaries on a live system can be found [here](tutorial.html).

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [tetherless@cs.rpi.edu]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
