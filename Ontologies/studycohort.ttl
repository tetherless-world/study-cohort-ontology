  dc:description """
        The Study Cohort Ontology encodes the vocabulary to represent population desriptions in research studies, and provides the ability to model the aggregative descriptive statistical measures defined on the variables of subjects who are participants in the study population. We make it possible to represent a study component considered for determining the patient alignment to a research study, and we assist physicians in evaluating the fit of their patient population to the study population. In SCO, we are building a world-view inspired by the upper level Ontology SemanticScience Integrated Ontology (SIO) to model the descriptive statistics of characteristics on a set of patients (patient group) administered a medical intervention, and studied for an outcome in a research study.  Since we capture the various definitions of patient groups (ie. by interventional measures or by control mechanisms), we provide the basic framework for filtering searches and to define cohort similarity at different granularities. ( cohort level and the study group levels ). For researchers who wish to contribute to the expansion of our ontology, we advise that they refer to our ontology documentation to familiarize themselves with the structure and term annotations ( such as definitions and labels).
        """ ;
  dc:abstract """
        The Study Cohort Ontology (SCO) is developed to model overall structure and patterns of cohort variables and control/intervention groups defined within the structured population descriptions (commonly referred to as Table1's or Cohort Summary Tables)of observational case studies and clinical trials. We maintain only domain agnostic and commonly occuring subject variables and interventions in SCO, and we have a suite of ontologies (Diseases, Medications, LabResults etc) to encode Diabetes related terminology. We have adopted a bottom-up approach to modeling and we have revised the structure of SCO upon investigation of a few research studies (11 to be precise) from the Pharmacological Interventions (Chapter 8) and Cardiovascular Complications (Chapter 9) of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)’s Standards of Medical Care 2018 CPG. We enable deep drive visualizations driven off queries to knowledge graphs modeled on SCO, to help assist physician visualize the similarity of a patient to a study group, at a quick glance. We welcome contributions and suggestions to extend SCO to represent cohort descriptions of publications targeted to other diseases, and we plan to release set of tools to make this process seamless."""^^xsd:string ;
